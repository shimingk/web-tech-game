MP3 - atari breakout

<details><summary>write-up documentation</summary>

1. learn and set up my web development toolchain
2. Inspiration behind my game:
    - Pong
    - Peggle
    - Atari Breakout
3. Deciding on what external libraries to use for my game:
    - Game engines:
        - p5.play: ultmately p5.play was my choice due to the fact that it incorporates p5.js to render graphics
        - pixi.js
    - p5.js
        - an obvious choice from prior experience (MP2)
    - Three.js
        - 3D graphics
4. Implementing the Game
    - Using p5.play library in my game
        - using sprites for bricks: moving bricks adds a level of complexity to a typical pong game
    - adjusting Window screen size for the game
    - 
5. Issue deep dive
